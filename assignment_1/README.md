# Assignment 1: notMNIST

## Instructions
**Preprocess notMNIST data and train a simple logistic regression model on it**

**Note**: First install TensorFlow and fetch starter code for all assignments, as described [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud730/l-6452084188).

#### Starter Code

Open the iPython notebook for this assignment [(1_notmnist.ipynb)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb), and follow the instructions to implement and run each indicated step. Some of the early steps that preprocess the data have been implemented for you.

#### Evaluation

This is a self-evaluated assignment. As you go through the notebook, make sure you are able to solve each problem and answer the posed questions (save your responses as markdown in the notebook).

In the end, you should have a model trained on the notMNIST dataset, which is able to recognize a subset of English letters in different fonts. How accurately does your model predict the correct labels on the test dataset?
